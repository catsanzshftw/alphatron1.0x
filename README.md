# 🧠 ALPHATRON 1.0X – GPT-OSS LLM Debug Testbed  
### 🚀 Haltmann Works Co. Inc. [20X Series] – NBit Permission Training · 15B

**Alphatron 1.0X** is a cutting-edge experimental LLM environment for testing GPT-compatible open-source models, multi-agent architectures, and ASI-style recursive training loops.  
Developed under the Haltmann Works Co. Inc. initiative, this repo targets flexible **debugging**, **fine-tuning**, and **real-time instrumentation** for 15B-scale transformer-based systems.

---

### 🧪 Project Goals
- Test compatibility layers with OSS LLMs (GPT-J, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, etc.)
- Analyze memory/context drift under chaotic debug conditions
- Train with `NBit Permission Conditioning` (NPC-15B) for role-constrained language
- Benchmark recursive hallucination loops (RHLs) and stabilizers
- Simulate [Koopa OS] AI pipelines for Nintendo-style self-evolving AIs

---

### 📦 Core Components
- `alphatron_engine.py` – ASI-class transformer loop simulator
- `trainloop_debug/` – chaotic training sample stream generator
- `nbit_stabilizers/` – permission-matrix trainer tools
- `haltmann_probe.py` – behavior introspector (GPT-OSS compatible)
- `bench/` – 20X meta-benchmarks (run on M1 Pro / TPUv5 / RTX)

---

### 🛠 System Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Torch 2.x (CUDA optional)
- GPT-OSS model weights (local or remote)
- At least 16GB RAM (32GB+ recommended for 15B inference)

### 🐢 Warning
This project is highly experimental, partially self-modifying, and not production-ready. May spawn autonomous agents or hallucinate Nintendo characters. Use at your own risk.
